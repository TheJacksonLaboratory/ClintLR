Clinical Intuition with Likelihood Ratios

ClintLR is an extension of the LIRICAL algorithm that boosts the pretest probability of groups of related diseases deemed to be more likely.

Please see the [documentation](https://thejacksonlaboratory.github.io/ClintLR/) for instructions on how to set up and use ClintLR.

The latest release of ClintLR can be found [here](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/ClintLR/releases).

(A) Users can download input files and adjust settings via the setup interface. (B) The main analysis interface allows users to choose the disease group and adjust the pretest probability of the group to reflect clinical intuition. (C) ClintLR the runs LIRICAL with the adjusted pretest probabilities and displays the results in the system browser.")
