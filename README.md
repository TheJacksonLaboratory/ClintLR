Clinical Intuition with Likelihood Ratios

ClintLR incorporates clinical intuition into the LIRICAL algorithm by boosting the pretest probability 
of groups of related diseases.

We provide a graphical user interface to set up the analysis.

![Screenshot of the ClintLR interface](docs/_static/ClintLR_screenshot_and_results.png
"ClintLR (CLinical INTuition with Likelihood Ratios). (A) Users can download input files and adjust settings via the setup interface.
(B) The main analysis interface allows users to choose the disease group and adjust the pretest probability
of the group to reflect clinical intuition.
(C) ClintLR runs LIRICAL with the adjusted pretest probabilities and displays the results in the system browser.")

The latest release of ClintLR can be found [here](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/ClintLR/releases).

Please see the [documentation](https://thejacksonlaboratory.github.io/ClintLR/) for instructions on how to set up and use ClintLR.
